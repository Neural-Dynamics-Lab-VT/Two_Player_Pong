# Playing pong using EEG
## Under development

## Getting started

### Requirements


### Running
1. Connect your EEG headset and stream the EEG signals as an LSL stream. Checkout this [repo](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer)
for more details.

2. Start OpenVibe Designer and run the provided xml files under the `OpenVibe_scenarios` folder. This processes the 
EEG signal and extracts the beta power which is later streamed using LSL.

3. Run `play_pong.py` to start the game.
